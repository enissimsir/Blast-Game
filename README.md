Unfortunately, since the mission came at a bad time, I could only use 7 days of the 10-day period. Also, I couldn't complete the game because I haven't made a game like this before.

I did my best. Even though I wrote a very optimized and efficient code, there is a lot missing in terms of game content.

Some features that I couldn't finish:
- No animation at all
- Editor menu items are not implemented. You must finish the first chapter to open the next chapter.
- Obstacles outside the box have not been improved.
- No rockets at all
- Some bugs
